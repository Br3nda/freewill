# freewill

This is a free, open source legal software for people wishing to make a will in accordance with New Zealand law.

I was a general practice lawyer and I saw a need for everyone to have a will. A will is simply your wish for what happens to your things (money, property, favourite thing) after you die. If you don't have a will then your loved ones might fight over what you 'would have wanted to do'. 

I've learnt some web dev skills and I want to empower people!

Disclaimer: The wills produced by this app are like off-the-shelf clothing. If you want something that is tailor-made to your specific circumstance, please talk to a lawyer.
